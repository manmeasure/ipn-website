<p> We do not know and we never will.
  Protagoras of Abdera (490?-420? BCE) has sparked the imagination of many a thinker and author:
  philosophers, playwrights, biographers and historiographers have engaged with his thinking,
  with his person, with the implications of his ideas.
  These interactions have resulted in a series of <b>portraits of Protagoras</b>:
  as a a sophist, a theorist of democracy, the founding father of relativism,
  utilitarianism or pragmatism, an agnost, a grammarian, a professional teacher. </p>
