<h1>Some Principles of Charity</h1>

  <ol id="charity">
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary">1.</span>&nbsp;We aim to reconstruct <b>representations</b> of <a href="./?page=whoisprotagoras">Protagoras of Abdera</a>
      <!-- insert link to Who is Protagoras --> and the works and thought attributed to him.</li>
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary float-right">2.</span>&nbsp;We focus on different types of representations and echoes, including imitations, adaptations, transformations and amplifications.</li>
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary">3.</span>&nbsp;We do not aim to reconstruct a ‘biography’ of the historical person Protagoras or his ‘works’.
      Given the nature of our sources we do not deem this feasible.</li>
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary float-right">4.</span>&nbsp;We envisage our edition as a network of <a href="#">"‘versions of Protagoras’</a>.
      This means that we do not distinguish between testimonia and fragmenta,
      between ‘mentions of Protagoras’ and ‘re-uses of text’, or between positive, neutral and hostile representations:
       all our sources are instances of reception.</li>
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary">5.</span>&nbsp;We aim to include a wider range of Nachleben in our collection than is currently customary.</li>
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary float-right">6.</span>&nbsp;Sources have an author. Representations of Protagoras involve a form of <a href="#">interaction</a> with the person Protagoras,
      his thought and his works. This means that “the character of the quoter must (…) be borne in mind” (MOST (1997), vii). </li>
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary">7.</span>&nbsp;For an edition of representations of Protagoras, it is fundamental that this ‘context’ is taken into account and made visible.
      This necessitates a larger ‘cutout’ of sources than is currently customary in fragment editions.</li>
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary float-right">8.</span>&nbsp;Our material is organized along <b>two main axes</b>: a <b>thematic</b> axis that organizes various and disparate sources
      around certain themes pertaining to Protagoras (e.g., the Man Measure Statement),
      and a <b>textual</b> axis that follows the logic and flow of the source text (e.g., Plato, <i>Theaetetus</i>). </li>
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary">9.</span>&nbsp;Our primary aim in providing a digital edition is to present the user with <b>scholarship about</b> these data:
      we make our judgments, decisions, discussions and uncertainties optimally visible and transparent.</li>
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary float-right">10.</span>&nbsp;An important aim of our digital edition is to provide material for more extended scholarly research on Protagoras,
      covering topics like the history of democracy, the history of literary criticism and ancient epistemology.  </li>
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary">11.</span>&nbsp;The publication will be finished and published in a definitive edition within the course of 5 (?) years.
      However, the collection of Protagorean texts should remain open for the addition of new texts. </li>
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary float-right">12.</span>&nbsp;Our digital edition will provide an example for other editions of this kind,
      because we develop a new methodology of presenting a ‘corpus’ of fragmentary texts,
      presenting more contextual data than can be provided in conventional printed editions.</li>
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary">13.</span>&nbsp;The digital edition will also provide an efficient visualization of the network of ancient representations of Protagoras.  </li>
    <li <li class="timeline-item"><span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary float-right">14.</span>&nbsp;Publication of a printed volume may remain a viable option. </li>
