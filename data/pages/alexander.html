<p>To help us in our development of our digital edition we decided to create a digital collaboration environment. Because this name
    doesn't really roll off the tongue, we gave it the name <em>Alexander</em>.

    In Alexander we handle our team based international workflow and staged review process. Unfortunately access to Alexander is restricted,
