<h1>Who Are We?</h1>
<p>The International Protagoras Network is an international group of scholars
  devoted to reconstruct a rich but elusive chapter in the European History of Ideas:
  the <a href="#">Protagorean tradition</a>. <!-- insert link to Who is Protagoras?-->
  We are classical philologists and scholars of ancient and modern philosophy,
  from Leiden, Aix-en-Provence, Pisa, TÃ¼bingen, Tokyo.
  We analyze, rethink and debate the Protagorean tradition and
  aim to make both the weaker and the stronger logos visible
  for any audience interested in <a href="#">Protagoras of Abdera</a> <!--insert link to Who is Protagoras -->
  and his lost works.</p>
