<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<p>We see the <a href="#">Protagorean tradition</a> <!--link naar Who is Protagoras? -->
  as a many-colored multifaceted portrait gallery.
  We <b>collect</b>, <b>edit</b> and <b>annotate</b> these portraits:
  we aim to reconstruct <b>historical representations</b> of the person Protagoras,
  his thought and his (alleged) works: <a href="#">an edition of a network of “versions of Protagoras”</a>.
  <!-- insert link to Man Measure -->
  We focus on stories, notions and concepts attributed to or associated with <a href="./?page=whoisprotagoras">Protagoras</a>
  <!-- insert link to Who is Protagoras? -->
  —a kaleidoscopic variety that we will try to do justice to in a digital edition
  of sources and their intricate relations. </p>
